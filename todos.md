# Phase One - Client Only App

- Solidity Contract Strucutre Brainstorming
- Basic Prototype of Registry System in Mongo
- Guest-Access Contract Creator based on top of that
- Deployment method (use client-only for now, generate a string)
- Actual deployment

# Phase Two - Server-side Deployment

- Login option for deployers

- For now the deployment is free at a cost of the server

# Phase Three - 3rd Party Payement Gateways

  - Bitcoin
  - PayPal
  - Citi

- Withdrawl - recipients can already withdraw their eth securely, but we want to make it convenient too
